    <h2>About Tool</h2>
    <p>
      CCD: CUDACodesmellDetector is a tool to detect code smells in CUDA programming language.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>About CUDA:</b> CUDA is used in parallel programming, to facilitate faster and complex codes which need GPU(Graphical User Interface) assistance along with CPU processing. The first release of NVidia CUDA was in 2007, and since then, there have been tremendous applications built using this interface.
